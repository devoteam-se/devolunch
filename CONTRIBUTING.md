## Setup Development Environment

### Website

1. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Run the server and the client
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```
3. If you want to run the program in Docker (not necessary):
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

That's it!

### Scraper and Slack notifier

Go to their respective directories ([./server/functions/scraper/](./server/functions/scraper/) and [./server/functions/notify-slack/](./server/functions/notify-slack/))

1. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Build Typescript to Javascript (named compile since Cloud Functions runs `build` automatically when deploying it)
   ```sh
   pnpm compile
   ```
3. Run it
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```
